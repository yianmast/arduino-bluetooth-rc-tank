# Arduino Bluetooth RC Tank ðŸ¤–ðŸ“±

Control a DIY tank using your smartphone and Bluetooth! This project is based on the original [Instructables guide](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Bluetooth-RC-Tank/) and allows you to build a remote-controlled tracked vehicle using an Arduino and HC-05 Bluetooth module.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Full directional control via Bluetooth app
- Dual motor driver for tank-style movement
- Reusable chassis with optional 3D-printed components
- Works with Android Bluetooth controller apps

## ðŸ§  How It Works

The Arduino receives commands via Bluetooth (HC-05) from an Android app. Based on the received character (`'F'`, `'B'`, `'L'`, `'R'`, `'S'`), the Arduino sets motor directions via the L298N module to move the tank.

---

## ðŸ“² Bluetooth App

You can use apps like:

- **Bluetooth Terminal HC-05**
- **Arduino Bluetooth Controller**
- **Bluetooth RC Controller** (recommended)

Buttons in the app send single-character commands like:

| Command | Action     |
|---------|------------|
| `F`     | Forward    |
| `B`     | Backward   |
| `L`     | Turn Left  |
| `R`     | Turn Right |
| `S`     | Stop       |

## ðŸ”§ Assembly Instructions

1. Connect all components per the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the code from `arduino/robot.ino` using the Arduino IDE.
3. Power the motors and Arduino (separately if needed).
4. Pair the HC-05 module with your smartphone (default PIN is `1234` or `0000`).
5. Open the app and start driving!

## ðŸ§± 3D Files

Located in the [`3d-files/`](./3d-files/) directory:

- `tank_body.stl`: Base frame for motors
- `motor_mount.stl`: Motor holders or brackets

Print with PLA or PETG. M3 screws recommended for assembly.
